Tilia Documentation
========================================

Acknowledgements
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This documentation would not be possible without the extrordinary work of Eric C. Grimm who has spent countless hours developing the Tilia platform.  The documentation here makes use of content and structure initially developed by K.C. Maguire, C. Jorgensen, and J. Blois as part of an effort to input mammal records into the Neotoma Paleoecological Database.

This document is in continuous development.  Currently this document supports Tilia v2.0.  To contribute to this document use the `GitHub`_ repository.  You can either raise Issues or contribute directly to the documentation.  You can also edit the documentation (through GitHub) by clicking the "Edit On GitHub" link at the top right of this page.  You must have a GitHub account to do this.  If you don't, please send me a note about suggested edits by `email`_.
