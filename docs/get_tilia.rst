The downloaded file contains a single file *setup_tilia_X_Y_ZZZ.exe* (where the X, Y and ZZZ represent the version numbering).

Installing Tilia on a Macintosh or Linux Machine
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tilia is built on a platform that requires the use of Windows.  Given its popularity however, people have found solutions for using the software on multiple platforms.

*The following instructions were kindly provided by `Jonathan Nichols`_:*
To run Tilia on an OSX machine, the following programs must be installed:

* WINE_ for Darwin and OSX.
* XQuartz_ (or X11 if you are using OSX 10.5 or older) must be installed.

Once Wine and XQuartz (or X11) are installed and running, navigate to the “Start” menu in Wine and select “Run”
